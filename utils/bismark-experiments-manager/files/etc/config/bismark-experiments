# bismark-updater will manage packages in the repositories listed in this
# file. The names are matched against the second field of src and src/gz lines
# in /etc/opkg.conf.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
#
# 1. Packages in these repositories should never be installed or removed except
# by bismark-experiments-manager.
# 2. The set of packages in these repositories must be disjoint from the set
# of packages available in all other repositories in /etc/opkg.conf. This is
# to prevent bismark-experiments-manager from accidently removing important
# packages that it doesn't manage.
